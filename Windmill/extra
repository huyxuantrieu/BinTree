This file takes the .txt file as an argument. It will import Sector#, Exposure#, and WindSpeed as data values and store the data in a triply-threated linkedlist. This linkedlist has 3 head pointers (one for each data) and is able to traverse through any of the 3 in numerical order. It also provides other information such as histograms of averages and sectors that are "bad" which have data values of -1.
